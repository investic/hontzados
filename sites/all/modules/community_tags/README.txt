  AUTHOR INFORMATION
-----------------------

Tagadelic was originally written by BÃ¨r Kessels and more information can be
found on http://www.webschuur.com/modules/tagadelic.

Carpentered in the webschuur.com

Additional modifications including weighted node tagging, the quick tag form and
user tags have been authored by Rob Barreca of Electronic Insight and more
information can be found at http://www.electronicinsight.com.

Cherry-picking from Rob Barreca's work and using it to create the Community Tags
module was done by Angela Byron of Lullabot with support from the Bryght guys.

Steven Wittens of Bryght updated this module to 5.x, cleaned up the code some more
and added more shiny features.
